All content is &copy; Atoms to Astronauts.

This version of the site is NOT written with responsiveness in mind, the clone is of the desktop layout.

The clone does not have any functionality, just the HTML and CSS, using the BEM methodology and written with SCSS compiled to CSS.

Here's a side by side comparison of the 2 sites, the original is on the left and the clone is on the right.
